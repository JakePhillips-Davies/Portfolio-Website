    Hi, I'm <b>Jake Phillips-Davies</b>. I am currently a computer science student
    studying games development, I am a self-taught artist, and this is my website.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you for visiting! It is interactive and functions much like you'd expect from
    a desktop, so feel free to have a look around. It doesn't work well on mobile yet
    however, sadly.
</p>
<p>
    I typically enjoy using game-dev and digital drawing as my creative outlet. Today however,
    I am using web-dev as a creative outlet to hopefully bring you a more enjoyable visit to
    my portfolio.

    This website was made as a hobby project using HTML, CSS and JS, so please mind the rough edges.
